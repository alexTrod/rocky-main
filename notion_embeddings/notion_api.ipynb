      "Organizational Structure: Embracing a Hybrid Model at Rockfeather\n",
      "We want to provide you with a understanding of our unique organizational structure, which combines a flat hierarchy, inspiration from Finext and Ricardo Semler, and elements of Holacracy.\n",
      "The Influence of Finext and Ricardo Semler\n",
      "Rockfeather is proud to be a spin-off from Finext, a renowned organization known for its innovative and self-steering approach. We have also drawn inspiration from the pioneering work of Ricardo Semler, who advocates for empowerment and autonomy in the workplace.\n",
      "Taking the strengths of these influences into account, we have designed an organizational model that emphasizes the following:\n",
      "- Empowerment and autonomy: -  We believe in empowering individuals by giving them the freedom to make decisions and take ownership of their work. This fosters a sense of autonomy, allowing you to contribute your talent and make a significant impact on our collective success.\n",
      "- Reduced bureaucracy: -  Our aim is to minimize unnecessary layers of management and bureaucracy. By embracing a flat hierarchy, we streamline decision-making processes, enabling us to be agile and responsive to change.\n",
      "- Improved communication and collaboration: -  A key benefit of the flat hierarchy is the emphasis on open communication channels, which enables information to flow freely and collaboration to thrive. With fewer barriers, ideas and insights can be shared more readily, leading to increased innovation and problem-solving.\n",
      "Understanding the Flat Hierarchy\n",
      "At Rockfeather, our organizational structure is primarily based on a flat hierarchy. Unlike traditional hierarchies with multiple layers of management, a flat hierarchy promotes inclusivity and collaboration. It means we have fewer levels of management, fostering a democratic and participatory work environment. With a flat hierarchy, communication is more direct, decision-making is faster, and everyone's voice is valued.\n",
      "Incorporating Elements of Holacracy\n",
      "While our organizational model is rooted in a flat hierarchy, we have also incorporated certain elements of Holacracy, an innovative organizational system. Holacracy distributes authority and decision-making power throughout the company, replacing traditional management roles with self-organizing teams or circles.\n",
      "Inspired by Holacracy,  we ensure clear role definitions and accountabilities, fostering transparency and ensuring that everyone understands their responsibilities and areas of authority.  Additionally, regular governance meetings provide a platform to address tensions, resolve issues, and drive continuous improvement as a team.\n",
      "The Hybrid Approach: Embracing the Flat Hierarchy\n",
      "Our hybrid model at Rockfeather blends the strengths of a flat hierarchy with insights from Holacracy. This approach allows us to benefit from:\n",
      "- Open communication and collaboration fostered by the flat hierarchy, promoting inclusivity and active participation.\n",
      "- Empowerment and autonomy, providing individuals with the freedom to make decisions and take ownership of their work.\n",
      "- Clear roles and responsibilities, influenced by elements of Holacracy, promoting transparency and accountability.\n",
      "- Regular meetings to address tensions, resolve issues, and drive continuous improvement.\n",
      "What It Means for You as a Rockfeather Rockstar?\n",
      "As an engaged professional at Rockfeather, our organizational structure based on a flat hierarchy and elements of Holacracy will have tangible implications for your experience within the company:\n",
      "- Greater Autonomy - : You will have the freedom to make decisions and take ownership of your work. This autonomy allows you to contribute your expertise and shape the direction of your projects and development.\n",
      "- Collaborative Environment - : The emphasis on open communication and collaboration fosters a supportive and inclusive work culture. You will have opportunities to engage with colleagues, share ideas, and collectively solve challenges.\n",
      "- Clear Role Expectations - : Our clear role definitions ensure that you understand your responsibilities and areas of authority. This clarity helps you navigate your role effectively and contribute to the success of our organization.\n",
      "- Opportunities for Growth - : Our organizational structure encourages continuous learning and personal development. You will have the chance to explore new areas of interest, take on challenges, and expand your skill set.\n",
      "At Rockfeather, we are committed to creating an environment that empowers our employees, fosters collaboration, and values open communication. We believe that our hybrid model, influenced by Finext, Ricardo Semler, and elements of Holacracy, provides a framework for success and innovation in the workplace.\n",

      "At Rockfeather, we draw inspiration from the Rockefeller Habits and the Scale Up methodology by Verne Harnish, shaping our goal-setting routine. We prioritize accountability, continuous learning, and creativity in our plan-making process. Let's take a closer look at how we do it:\n",
      "Kick-Off and Collaboration : We start with a gathering of the team leads and the leadership team. It's a time for sharing ideas, fostering collaboration, and unleashing our creativity.  This usually happens a month before the quarterly meeting,  setting the stage and looking forward to an awesome adventure ahead!\n",
      "Team Creativity : Each team lead invites their team members to contribute their unique insights and aspirations to the plan. We encourage everyone to let their imagination run wild, bringing their best ideas to the table. This is where the magic happens!\n",
      "Alignment and Refinement : As the quarterly meeting approaches, the leadership team and team leads come together to review and align the draft versions of our plans. This ensures that we're all on the same page and allows for necessary refinements to make our plans solid.\n",
      "Finalization and Celebration : With feedback incorporated and refinements made, we add the finishing touches to our plans. But that's not all — we also take time to celebrate our collective achievements and embrace our oopsie moments during the quarterly meeting. After all, we learn and grow from both our successes and challenges.\n",
      "Ongoing Support : To keep the momentum going, we hold weekly team meetings and monthly performance reviews. These reviews provide us with the support and guidance we need to stay focused on our goals. They're an opportunity to address challenges, offer feedback, and keep moving forward together.\n",
      "So, as we start off on this adventure…, we're reminded of the wisdom shared by Bill Gates: \"Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.\"\n",
      "At Rockfeather, we embrace this mindset, valuing long-term thinking and the growth it brings. Our goal-setting routine allows us to pursue both short-term wins and long-term success.\n",
      "At Rockfeather, we believe in the power of teamwork. We link personal learning goals with our company's mission, making the journey as rewarding as the destination. Together, we unleash the power of data and automation, all while having fun along the way. Let's make a positive impact and rock our goals!\n",

      "The Rockefeller Habits, originally developed by John D. Rockefeller, are a set of principles and practices that have been popularized by Verne Harnish in his book \"Mastering the Rockefeller Habits.\" These habits are designed to help businesses achieve sustainable growth by focusing on specific areas, such as having a clear vision, prioritizing goals, and creating a culture of accountability.\n",
      "In addition to these central tenets, the habits consist of a variety of other key areas that businesses should focus on in order to achieve their goals. For instance, it is important for businesses to establish communication rhythms, develop a strategic plan, and provide adequate training to their employees. By doing so, businesses can ensure that everyone is on the same page and working toward the same objectives.\n",
      "Another key aspect of the Rockefeller Habits is hiring and retaining the right people. This means not just finding individuals with the right skills and experience, but also those who are a good fit for the company's culture. By creating a team of like-minded individuals who are committed to the company's goals, businesses can create a culture of accountability that encourages everyone to do their best work.\n",
      "It is also important for businesses to implement effective processes and use data to make informed decisions. By analyzing key metrics and using this information to guide their decisions, businesses can make sure that they are always moving in the right direction. Finally, having a disciplined execution is essential for ensuring that plans are carried out effectively and that everyone is held accountable for their actions.\n",
      "By focusing on these key areas, businesses can achieve sustainable growth and success. The Rockefeller Habits help businesses to stay focused on their goals and prioritize their efforts, which is essential for achieving long-term success.\n",

      "Clean desk policy \n",
      "A clean desk policy is a Marie Kondo approach to your workspace - it's all about decluttering and organizing! The main goal is that we can create a safe and clean environment where we can thrive. It comes down to the following: \n",
      "- Clear your desk of unnecessary stuff, like those old coffee cups and plates. Especially at the end of the day! \n",
      "- Don't forget about computer security - lock your computer when you're away from your desk. Otherwise, you might have to bake a cake for the whole office! \n",

      "General Intro to Making Expenses\n",
      "Within Rockfeather you can declare the expenses that you make to do your work. From getting food for your colleagues to the parking costs at the office. In this overview, you can see what, where, and how you can declare costs.\n",
      "One important thing within expenses and Rockfeather as a whole is “Common sense”. Use your common sense when making expenses. The expenses you have to do for work to create a good work environment are completely fine. Taking clients to a diner too. Just use your “common sense”.\n",
      "The best way of making expenses is doing it on the company directly, by use of the  Moss Card . This is 9 out of 10 times the correct instrument to use when making expenses. If you can’t pay by credit card you will have to cover the costs yourself first and afterward declare it in  Nmbrs .  More over both instruments can be found in the chapters below.\n",
      "Do make sure you always have your receipts to upload because you don’t want to end up on the list of shame ;). Having receipts is important because it serves as proof of the expense. It helps to ensure that the expense is valid and can be properly recorded and reimbursed. Additionally, receipts can be necessary for tax and accounting purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of expenses might be:\n",
      "- Fuel costs\n",
      "- Travel expenses\n",
      "- Public transport\n",
      "- Parking costs\n",
      "- Hotels\n",
      "- Gifts for a business relationship or a colleague\n",
      "- Activities\n",
      "- Study\n",
      "- Dinner or lunch\n",
      "- Marketing\n",
      "- Phone subscriptions\n",
      "How To?\n",
      "As said, there are two ways.\n",
      "Pay with your  Moss  card.\n",
      "Pay privately, and declare the expenses in  Nmbrs .\n",
      "For individual instructions on how to make the declaration or do the right administration, please check the referred pages in the previous bullets\n",
      "W hen do you get this reimbursed?\n",
      "The declaration is  settled monthly with the salary  if you do it through Nmbrs. Doing it through Moss will follow the general company payment term, which is twice every month. If you are waiting longer, something is wrong and please ask the finance department\n",
      "Other Expenses & General tips in making expenses:\n",
      "Parking costs\n",
      "use Easypark subscription from the office - Contact Paul Damen to gain access to this.\n",
      "Mobile phone  subscription costs\n",
      "when you only have one phone (no company phone) you can declare your invoice (please check upfront with the Finance team*) the subscription has to be only the connection and not the depreciation of your phone and it has to be a ‘proper’ subscription (meaning, a usual subscription like the company subscription would be)\n",
      "Switch phone number from private provider to company provider, to avoid making the declaration. Ask Paul for this.\n",
      "KM declaration\n",
      "For the people that have a mobility budget, you can enter your kilometers traveled and have it reimbursed for 21 cents (tax-free amount determined by the government in 2023) per kilometer . This can be declared in Moss with the KM Mileage.\n",

      "R eviewer(s):  Paul, Panu\n",
      "With both the onboarding and offboarding we try to keep our core values in mind. We might have digitalized some parts of the processes because of the scale, but we understand that in both cases, it is really personal and important to feel valued and respected, so we always try to stay human. We are not a big company where there is a super clear process, and an HR department is fully committed to onboarding and offboarding. Within Rockfeather the  Shepherds  are responsible for these processes, but of course, they get help from others. \n",
      "Onboarding\n",
      "We have an onboarding process to make sure that someone has a smooth start at Rockfeather. All onboardings are different, some start at a customer straight away and others need more time. We try to take this into account as much as possible.  The current process is as follows: \n",
      "- The process starts when someone is hired, status is updated in  - Recruitee -  \n",
      "- Shepherds & IT make sure that all the stuff is ready on the first day \n",
      "- The  - onboarding app -  is used to track the progress \n",
      "- Depending on the first project, one of the shepherds and a team member make a rough plan for the first couple of weeks\n",
      "- The responsible Shepherd is also the ‘buddy’, this means that he or she has contact with the new employee on a regular basis and is available for all sorts of questions\n",
      "- This buddy system is relatively new, but the idea is that everyone has a buddy until they have a coach or don’t need/want it anymore. \n",
      "Reasons for this process:\n",
      "- We have an onboarding process to make sure that someone has a smooth start at Rockfeather \n",
      "- All onboarding is different, some start at a customer straight away others need more time\n",
      "Offboarding\n",
      "Unfortunately, we also lose some soldiers once in a while. Currently, we are working on a formal off-boarding process. We do have a similar app in place, and the first test case has been done (June 2023). Although the process is less mature than the Onboarding, we do have a couple of steps that we take:  \n",
      "- Shepherds & IT make sure that all the hardware is handed in and wiped; also, the account, including licenses should be closed. We use the  - app -  to track this \n",
      "- The contract should be terminated, and the salary and holiday pay should be paid the month after.   - bonus -  (if applicable) and salary are paid.\n",
      "- Exit meeting is scheduled, if both parties want this of course. The goal of this meeting is to clear everything that is on everyone's chest. We can all learn from this and we always try to stay on good terms with Rockfeather Alumni. \n",
      "- An internal evaluation is done by a few people that worked closely with the person who left.  - This is done to  - learn from the from it. \n",
      "The idea is that in Q3 2023 the offboarding process is finalized and will be used from this point onwards.   \n",

      "In the past couple of years feedback became a important part of the identity of Rockfeather. While both receiving and giving feedback aren’t the most easiest jobs to do, we think that it will bring way more than the effort it should be. As we have a special way of doing for almost everything within Rockfeather, we also have our own way of giving feedback.\n",
      "WHY?  \n",
      "{}\n",
      "HOW?\n",
      "Feedback is something that you can get out of every conversation. If someone nods to you, they provide you with feedback that they agree or disagree on something. When Paul is checking out on the meeting, he think it is probably not of interest for him. If Alexander is saying that you are a no brainer to hire, he is a big fan of your skills.  So, feedback is everywhere. However, within Rockfeather we added two specific occasions to give and receive feedback. \n",
      "Team Feedback Sessions (TFS) \n",
      "(Un-) Comfortable Coffees\n",
      "Having an occasion created for feedback is making it easier to do, but ain’t gonna explain you HOW to give proper feedback. There are a couple of requirements that are important to take in mind when we are giving feedback within Rockfeather, which we added into a couple of core values for feedback. These values we created together and should be respected. \n",
      "DO’s and DONT’s \n",
      "First, it is always good to check-in/check-out to see if it is the right moment to give feedback. \n",
      "Bad example - Yo, you made a mess of the kitchen. \n",
      "Good example - Yo, do you have a minute to have a chat? I noticed some behaviour I would like to talk about. \n",
      "Secondly, while taking the values in consideration it is always important to speak out of your heart. Don’t hide yourself behind long unclear sentences and a group of people, but be clear and speak for yourself. \n",
      "Bad example -  We  think that you made a  mess of the room  \n",
      "Good example -  I  noticed that  you left your plate and cutlery at the lunch table , and it bothered me as  I want to keep this place clean  so everyone could work at a clean environment. \n",
      "Third, try always to level while having feedback. Ask questions to check if the two of you understand each other correctly \n",
      "Bad example - I think you are messing around. And oh yeah, I also disliked the way you talked to me. \n",
      "Good example - Hey, It felt as you were messing around with me. I didn’t like that. Could you understand that from my point of view? No? Alright, while, …. explain before go any further. \n",
      "WHEN?\n",
      "The answer is simple, as much as possible. Did you just had a call where you had some doubts about how you performed? Ask feedback. Did you just gave a kickass presentation and you are wondering what the audience thought about it? Ask feedback. Closing a project? Do feedback with the project group. \n",
      "And of course, we all had time struggling with sharing feedback. We are experts in overfloating the bucket before we do share our feelings. So, ask someone looking bold, old or being here within Rockfeather for more than 3 year to help you out on this, they went all through the same. \n",

We have established mechanisms like monthly meetings, quarterly days, and periodic emails from departments like People & Culture, Marketing, and Finance to keep everyone informed.

While not all may interest you, each email includes a table of contents to help you identify relevant topics (but if you’re a real fan you’ll read all the articles of course🙂).
